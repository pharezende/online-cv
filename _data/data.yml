career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student at Unicamp, Campinas, Brazil. My research field is computer networks. 
      My main areas of interest are: Software Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), 
      4G/5G networks, Network Slicing and Multi-Stream transport protocols.
      
      I have a strong background in computer networks, having more than 8 years of experience on them. I passed the CCNA exam
      in 2012 and was the vice champion of a computer network marathon in 2013. I have been working with SDN for around 7 years, developing
      solutions for all planes composing the SDN architecture. 
      

education:

    - degree: PhD in Computer Science
      university: Unicamp
      time: 2016 - Present
      details: |
        I'm currently developing mechanisms to realize Network Slicing in LTE Networks, in the E-UTRAN and EPC. Such networks
        will be employed as a base for future 5G mobile systems. Furthermore, these proposed mechanisms
        should use more efficiently the LTE network resources.
        
    - degree: MSc in Computer Science
      university: Federal University of Uberlândia
      time: 2014 - 2016
      details: |
        I extended an SDN Controller, enabling it to gather network metrics (e.g. delay, throughput). 
        Based on these metrics, the Controller pushes forwarding rules into the OpenFlow switches in order to send 
        network traffic over multiple paths, targeting to improve the end users' QoS experience. 

    - degree: BSc in Computer Science
      university: Federal University of Uberlândia
      time: 2009 - 2013
      details: |
        During this bachelor course, I learned the Computer Science theorical background and also had several programming courses.
        I started researching about Computer Networks during this course, focusing more on SDN.
          

experiences:
    - role: Visiting Researcher
      time: 2018
      company: Concordia University, Montreal, Canada
      details: |
        I was a visiting researcher working under the supervision of Prof. Roch Glitho. We developed a mechanism to 
        split multi-stream traffic over multiple paths on a OpenFlow network. The mechanism was further
        published in a good conference. 

    - role: Network Intern
      time: 2013
      company: Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil
      details: |
        During my internship, I worked with php, shell script, SNMP protocol, apache and 
        tomcat servers, digital certificates and Shibboleth (a logging-in system for Internet).
