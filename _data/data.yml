career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student at Unicamp, Campinas, Brazil. My research field is computer networks. 
      My main areas of interest are: Software Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), 
      4G/5G networks, Network Slicing and Multi-Stream transport traffic.
      
      I have a strong background in computer networks, having more than 8 years of experience on it. I also passed a CCNA certication
      in 2012 and was the vice champion of a computer network marathon in 2013. I have been working with SDN for around 7 years, developing
      solutions for all planes composing the SDN architecture. 
      

education:

    - degree: PhD in Computer Science
      university: Unicamp
      time: 2016 - Present
      details: |
        I'm currently developing mechanisms to realize Network Slicing in LTE Networks. Such networks
        will be employed as a base for future 5G mobile systems. Furthermore, these proposed mechanisms
        should use more efficiently the LTE network resources.
        
    - degree: MSc in Computer Science
      university: Federal University of Uberlândia
      time: 2014 - 2016
      details: |
        Relying on SDN, I developed a mechanism to gather network metrics (e.g. delay, throughput) and, 
        based on these metrics, it forwards the network traffic over multiple paths, targeting to improve the end users'
        QoS experience. 

    - degree: BSc in Computer Science
      university: Federal University of Uberlândia
      time: 2009 - 2013
      details: |
        During this course, I learned the Computer Science theorical background and also had several programming courses.
        I started researching about Computer Networks during this time, focusing more on SDN.
          

experiences:
    - role: Visiting Researcher
      time: 2018
      company: Concordia University, Montreal, Canada
      details: |
        I was a visiting researcher working under the supervision of Prof. Roch Glitho. We developed a mechanism to 
        split multi-stream traffic over multiple paths on top of an OpenFlow network. The mechanism was published on a good conference. 

    - role: Network Intern
      time: 2013
      company: Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil
      details: |
        During my internship, I worked with php, shell script, SNMP protocol, apache and 
        tomcat servers, digital certificates and Shibboleth (a logging-in system for Internet).
